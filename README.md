# tech-blog
For this project, I created a CMS-style blog site where developers can publish their blog posts and comment on other developersâ€™ posts. It follows the MVC paradigm: uses Handlebars.js as the Views, MySQL2 and Sequelize as the Model (Object-Relational Mapping), and the express-session npm package for the Controller. I also utilized dotenv, bcrypt, express-session and connect-session-sequelize packages to use environment variables, hash passwords, and add authentication.  Finally, I utilized Heroku to deploy the app.
